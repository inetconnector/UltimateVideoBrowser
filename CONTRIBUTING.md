# Contributing

Thanks for contributing!

## Ground rules

- Keep code comments in **English**.
- Keep user-facing UI strings localizable (use existing resources patterns).
- Run tests and ensure the app builds on at least one target platform before opening a PR.

## Legal (important)

This project uses a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** so Inetconnector.com can safely
commercialize the project (including offering proprietary/commercial licenses) without later
copyright fragmentation.

By submitting a pull request or any other Contribution, you agree to the terms in:

If you cannot agree to the CLA, please do not submit code.
