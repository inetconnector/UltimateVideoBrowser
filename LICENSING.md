# Licensing (Recommended Model)

This project is designed to be easy to adopt **and** easy to commercialize.

## Default (Community) License: Apache-2.0

The source code in this repository is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** (`LICENSE`).

Apache-2.0 is permissive: it allows commercial use, redistribution, and closed-source products,
while providing an explicit patent grant.

## Commercial licensing (optional)

Inetconnector.com can also offer a **commercial license** (see `LICENSES/INETCONNECTOR_COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.txt`)
for customers who want:

- a single negotiated contract (e.g., OEM bundling, procurement requirements)
- optional support/SLA/warranty terms
- trademark permissions (handled separately; see `TRADEMARKS.md`)

Commercial licensing applies **only** to the parts of the code owned by Inetconnector.com.

## Third-party software

This repository depends on third-party components (NuGet packages and ML models) which are licensed under
their own terms. These are not relicensed by Apache-2.0 or by any commercial agreement.

See:
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
- `LICENSES/`

### Six Labors Split License note

If you use Six Labors packages (e.g., ImageSharp), you must ensure you qualify for Apache-2.0 under their
split license, or obtain a Six Labors commercial license as required by your scenario.

## Contributions (CLA)

To keep the project commercial-friendly (dual licensing / OEM deals), contributions are accepted under a
Contributor License Agreement:

- `CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md`

By submitting a pull request or other Contribution, you agree to the CLA.
