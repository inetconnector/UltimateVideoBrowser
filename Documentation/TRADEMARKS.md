# Trademark & Brand Policy

This repository contains trademarks, logos, and brand identifiers owned by **Inetconnector.com** (the “Marks”),
including (but not limited to) “UltimateVideoBrowser”, “Inetconnector”, and associated logos.

## What you may do

- You may truthfully state that your product is “based on” or “forked from” this project.
- You may use the Marks in **nominative** form (plain text) to refer to the project (e.g., in documentation).

## What you may not do (without written permission)

- Use the Marks (or confusingly similar marks) in a way that suggests sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation.
- Distribute modified versions under the same product name, logo, or branding.
- Use logos/visual Marks in marketing materials for forks/derivatives.

## Why this exists

Open source licensing covers *copyright*, not *trademarks*. This policy helps keep the brand clear while allowing
the code to be reused under the license terms.

If you need permission for trademark use (e.g., OEM bundling, app-store listing under the same name),
contact Inetconnector.com.
